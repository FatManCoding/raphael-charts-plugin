Still alpha. Changes alot. Not ready for use yet. 

So far:
- added support for drawing 2d and 3d pie charts
- added support for drawing 3d horizontal and vertical bar charts
- works in all major browsers 

To be done:
- support for legends (like tooltips - using HTML elements, not SVG)
- support for 2d bar charts
- complete demo page with all possible options
- needs more testing on IE browsers.
